                <h4>What is your opinion about cats?</h4>
                <p>No, I don't like cats. I love them!!  Cats are mysterious, elegant, mischievous, playful and adorable beings. They do not obey any master or their mistress, they do not bend to anything and they command themselves. But, they are tender, faithful and sensitive towards their loved ones, that is, those who have known how to earn their affection. The key word is "win."  Making a feline love you is not easy and requires work. But it's worth it and I would gladly do it a thousand times.
